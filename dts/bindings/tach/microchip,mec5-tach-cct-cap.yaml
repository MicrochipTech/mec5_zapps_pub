      description: |
        Capture unit will store the current freerun counter value when the trigger
        input edge event occurs. Sofware must read this value before the next edge
        or it will be overwritten. If this property is not present edge detection
        will be disabled resulting in the capture register not updated.

        Enable input signal filter. The input signal must remain stable for three
        clocks of the selected frequency before an edge will be registered.
        Choose filter clock to be at least 4X the duration of the input signal pulse
        width.

    filter-bypass:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Bypass the input filter. When bypass is enabled the filter clock must
        be at least 2X the duration of the input signal pulse to be reliably
        detected.

      description: |
        Select one of 16 input signals to capture edges. Multiple capture
        units can be connected to the same signal. Please refer the chip
        documentation for the pins connected to CCT capture inputs. These pins
        must be present in the pinctrl-0 list for this device.
