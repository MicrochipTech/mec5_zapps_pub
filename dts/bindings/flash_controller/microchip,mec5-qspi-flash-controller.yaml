    description:
      SPI signalling mode specifying idle state of SPI clock and the clock edges
      for driving transmit data and sampling receive data. The default mode is SPI_MODE_0.

      For SPI Modes 0 and 3 the controller samples receive data on the clock rising edge
      and transmit data is driven on the clock falling edge. Mode 0 idle clock state is low
      whereas Mode 3 idle clock state is high.
